# Dynamic Adaptive Learning Environment (DALE) Framework

## Overview

The **Dynamic Adaptive Learning Environment (DALE)** framework is an innovative approach that integrates **EEG signal analysis** to address **vestibular dysfunction** in educational settings. Vestibular dysfunction significantly affects students' **cognitive** and **motor functions**, hindering learning outcomes. The DALE framework combines **EEG-driven Adaptive Environment Optimization Strategy (AEOS)** and reinforcement learning to dynamically monitor and optimize learning environments in real time, ensuring adaptability and personalization for students.

This repository provides the tools, models, and scripts necessary for implementing DALE and AEOS, enabling the identification of vestibular dysfunction and optimizing educational conditions to enhance inclusivity and learning outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Adaptive Learning Environment (DALE):**
  - Combines **spatial, temporal, and interactive environmental data** to detect vestibular dysfunction.
  - Uses EEG signal analysis for real-time monitoring of students' vestibular responses.

- **Adaptive Environment Optimization Strategy (AEOS):**
  - Leverages reinforcement learning and real-time feedback.
  - Optimizes environmental conditions to support students' specific needs.

- **Experimental Validation:**
  - Demonstrates significant improvements in:
    - Accuracy of vestibular dysfunction detection.
    - Environmental alignment with studentsâ€™ needs.
  - Advances the integration of **physiological signal analysis** into adaptive educational frameworks.

This approach underscores the importance of combining **physiological data analysis** with adaptive learning environments, contributing to **educational inclusivity** and supporting students with vestibular dysfunction.
